This project comprises a set of questionnaires for a survey conducted across management stakeholders to understand prospects of expansion.
A survey was conducted across members of varied hierarchy within an organization to vizualise their perspective on expanding into a different country.
Attached files include the survey database: which contains answers per question within the survey, and the data dashboard from which insights were created for a more dynamic project work.
